1- contact-methods: a brief summary of the contact methods we tried implementing. 

2-NTS_code_consistency: confirming the consistency of Node-To-Segment contact method. 

3-coding_the_Hessian: The derivation and discretization of the Hessian from Flory-Rehner constitutive law

4-NTS interaction method: describing the NTS method and the method I developed to implement global and local contact search. 

5-Gradient Dynamics Method: a short description of the GD solution method for the quasi-static dynamics as implemented in the FEA code.

6-comments_on_Menuts_v1.0: a documentation of my proof of a major conceptual error in one of the most cited paper in the field. This error changes the whole narrative about an experimental observation as confirmed by our calculations and simulations.

7-smoothed-contact-notes: a description of how I developed the contact smoothing algorithm

8-smoothed-contact-notes: My derivation of the equations of the tetrahedron element when we were going 3D. We discontinued effort in this direction since we were of limited time.
